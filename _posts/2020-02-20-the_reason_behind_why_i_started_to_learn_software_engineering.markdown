The only thing I want to do in my life is travel, I was looking for a way to make good income and be able to live abroad. I have a friend in the industry and from what I saw well I saw a whole bunch of gibberish that all the sudden become a website and that intrested me. So I did a whole lot of reasearch and realized this is me. I like to create things I like challenges and these things come with this carrer path and I was hooked. I did more research (you can never do too much research) I found coding bootcamps applied to a few that met my standards and now I'm here pursing this now dream of mine to become a Software Engingeer.
